        "businessPlan": "<p>THE PROBLEM We started Peeka with one big idea in mind: to help make reading fun again for kids, and to do so with virtual reality for everyone. This all started with our co-founder Michael's cousin, who hates to read. As a 3rd grader, he would call Michael on the phone to do his reading assignments, by order of his mother, and Michael could hear that his cousin wasn't processing any of what he was reading aloud, and instead, was just ready to get over it. This is the story for many parents and educators who struggle with getting their kids to read books, especially in a mobile landscape where kids are getting access to mobile devices younger, and those mobile devices are beating out kid's attention for books. Even major publishers cannot find their footing with simple nor interactive e-books, as evidenced by the flat or declining sales figures across the last 5 years. IT STARTED WITH ONE BOOK To help kids like Michael's cousin love reading again, the Peeka team knew we had to make it fun, and it'd have to be better than what's available today. Michael used to work at Disneyland, where he wanted to make rides. In that vein, and to make it feel like users were jumping into the pages of picture books, we made our first VR picture book from the existing book \"Farful Foolong from Oolong Panshoo\" by Nick Loren. Using the actual art and assets from the book, we created a virtual reality experience controlled and navigated by the child in VR, that helps them explore the scenes and interact with the story in ways that exceed the utility of iPads, video games, computers or mobile devices alone. In Peeka VR books, users navigate their experience with stars that prompt text, so that it is not only read by the user, it's narrated aloud by the author or a narrator themselves. The effect, coupled of course with being \"inside\" the pages, among the characters and scenes, positively impacts both comprehension and engagement with texts, as evidenced in early studies with schools in South Carolina, Idaho and Washington. Now, we're finishing up our third book of our first set, and are eager to work on building out the future of Peeka's VR library. DEMOCRATIZING ACCESS TO VR When we first began working on building Peeka, VR was just hitting it's most recent stride, and headsets cost over $600, not including the costly computers that could easily push the entire setup to well over $2,000. While the technology was mind-blowing, it wasn't feasible for anyone but hardcore adopters to use, or even develop with. Recognizing where we stand, and building with all of the contexts in mind, Peeka cleverly leverages technology found in most of our pockets - the smartphone, and a simply cardboard or plastic VR headset to bring our VR library of books to life. This set up alone has already transported thousands of kids into the pages of \"Farful Foolong\", in schools, museums and after school programs from coast-to-coast. Who knows where the future will take us? See the video here (https://wjcl.com/article/what-new-technology-will-jasper-county-students-see-in-their-classrooms/25403186) to see ABC news coverage of the first VR literacy program in America launched in Jasper County, S.C. HOW PEEKA WORKS: AN ARCADE FOR LEARNING We've built mobile platform and are also creating the content that will define a new category and industry. In other words, Peeka is building the VR picture books, and in doing so, we're defining together what reading and learning in virtual reality should be like. Soon, we'll invite other creators to use our toolkits to create their own content for our platform, as well as acquire content that complements our audiences. Our vision is for all kids VR content value to accrue back to Peeka. Peeka works with publishers and authors to bring their IP into VR, and thereby give them a stake into the future of storytelling. By experiencing their favorite stories in VR, children will engage deeper with reading, and increase their reading comprehension. The full scope benefits of VR make storytelling that much more rich, especially for children. Our mobile app, which is fully launched on iOS and Android, hosts our growing VR library in a Netflix-style selection process. Users spend tokens (purchased by an adult) to gain unlimited rental access to the VR books of their choice for the day. Today, we've completed three VR books and have begun production on our fourth. WHERE WE GO FROM HERE: We are introducing a whole new generation of children to VR, and their parents too. In the process, we are creating an ecosystem of VR content creators and extending the opportunity to make VR content for children as easy as possible on Peeka. We are asking you to join Peeka, and our partners like The Pacific Science Center, SURF Incubator, Jasper County School District, Nampa School District, NWAIS, and more in realizing our vision to make reading fun again for our kids. With the proceeds from the crowdfunding event, Peeka will be able to work towards and accomplish the following objectives, as many as funds allow: 1. Grow our VR Content Library: For every $6,000, we can create a new VR experience with the Peeka studio team here in Seattle, WA. 2. Complete new app features for parents and teachers: Imagine letting a parent or educator share in the experience of their child. That's possible, with your help. 3. Onboard 10+ enterprise partners: More school districts, more libraries. Let's dominate together.</p>",

If that pie is now a 500 Million dollar pie, and you have been diluted to .5% ownership, your slice of the piece is now worth 2.5 Million dollars. Dilution is a natural process as the company increases in value. We currently do not have any convertible notes outstanding.

                "answer": "Where we land today is that virtual reality is not dangerous for eyesight, a view supported both by university research (check out Marty Banks, professor of optometry, vision science, psychology, and neuroscience at UC Berkeley) and by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/are-virtual-reality-headsets-safe-eyes). The \"why\" behind this is because VR makes you focus in depth - that is, you see things in VR that are far away from you. Where watching an iPad or TV up close to your eyes is potentially damaging to the degree that a person is forcing their corneas to repeatedly focus differently than it's used to.\n\nSome research is even showing that VR can improve eyesight (https://www.aao.org/Assets/2dac9f9a-81b8-4260-a0cf-8e185acd22e4/636737811504330000/october-2018-feature-a-pdf). I will spare you the details because research is still early, but it's an exciting future.",

        "financialProjection": "<p>In the short-term, Peeka will continue to focus on building out the platform and developing content. We will also begin to start selling to enterprise customers (schools, hospitals, educational programs, etc) as well as launch the full version of our mobile application. The revenues in the short term are not as important to us relative to on-boarding users and creating more content. In the long-term, the potential revenues are tremendous. In 2018, the average price of a children's hardcover book was ~$18.70 and a paper back was ~$11.20. (https://www.slj.com/?detailStory=sljs-average-book-prices-2018) Currently, the average rental period on Peeka costs~$0.85, and this grants the user a 12 hour rental period where they can read the book as many times as they want. Assuming a user rents on Peeka 10 times per month on average, we will generate ~$8.50 per user per month. If 1,000,000 users are spending roughly this much, that equates to $102M per year. This revenue would just be from the consumer side, Peeka will also be selling to enterprise customers such as schools, hospitals, enrichment programs, museums, etc.. The long-term revenue opportunities with enterprises such as schools, hospitals, educational programs, etc will continue to compound as these entities are significantly investing in hardware while subscribing to a content subscription annually. Once we have enough content to warrant a subscription, we may choose to offer an unlimited subscription for $8-10 a month to the consumers. We will make this decision based on how many users are normally spending more than the potential subscription cost per month at the time. The subscription would equate to each user spending between ~$96 to $120 per year on Peeka. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Separately, there are some major opportunities we are in the middle of sussing out. These opportunities range from creating content for a series of Netflix titles, to significant deals state wide with Florida and/or Mississippi. These opportunities would open up new revenue streams for Peeka that were otherwise thought to not be possible until a much later date. Should Peeka be able to capitalize on these opportunities, the short-term revenue projections would drastically change (for the better).</p>",

Our mission is to create delightful experiences that increase reading engagement, comprehension and retention.\n\nScreens are competing for children’s attention, and they’re winning. Parents can’t get their kids to put down their screens and pick up a book without a fight. With literacy being the foundation for many educators, schools struggle to engage students to read, especially underfunded districts. Peeka aims to fill that gap and help inspire reluctant readers to build the skills that will help them develop.\n\nPublishers have been fighting declining print book sales consistently for the past decade and see a more complex and even less stable future with e-book publishing. \n\nVR has a content problem that’s hemorrhaging adoption. Not only are the options for children extremely limited, the content landscape in general is arid and wholly explorative or one-off.
